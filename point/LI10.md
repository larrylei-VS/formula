#### Commentary

Shǒusānlǐ LI-10 (Arm Three Miles), just distal to the elbow joint, mirrors the location of [Zúsānlǐ ST-36](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-36) (Leg Three Miles) on the leg and shares its name. Although both points have the action of harmonising the Stomach and intestines, this is a secondary and relatively minor action of Shǒusānlǐ LI-10.

Yangming channels are "abundant in qi and blood"[10](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-large-intestine-channel/references), and in the same way that [Zúsānlǐ ST-36](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/ST-36) is a primary point to treat disorders of the lower limb, the main clinical application of Shǒusānlǐ LI-10 is to invigorate and regulate the circulation of qi and blood in the upper limb as a whole. It is much used in the treatment of both atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, as well as pain, immobility and numbness of the arm, in which case it is often combined with such points as [Jiānyú LI-15](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-15) and [Hégǔ LI-4](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-4) in the 'chain and lock' point combination method. Shǒusānlǐ LI-10 is often alternated with [Qūchí LI-11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-11) in the treatment of chronic and long-standing disorders of the channels such as hemiplegia and atrophy disorder, to avoid over-needling the same few points. Shǒusānlǐ LI-10 is also often clinically combined with [Qūchí LI-11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-11) as an adjacent point for diseases of the elbow, particularly tennis elbow.

As far as the treatment of toothache is concerned, Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty recommended applying moxibustion to Shǒusānlǐ LI-10 for toothache of the upper jaw (and to [Sānjiān LI-3](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/point/LI-3) for toothache of the lower jaw)[11](https://app.amanualofacupuncture.com/book/pages/channels/the-large-intestine-channel/references).

#### Summary of clinical application

Often alternated with Quchi LI-11 when frequent treatment is given in longterm hemiplegia, atrophy disorder etc.
- Zhu Dan-xi recommended applying moxibustion for toothache of the upper jaw.
- Indicated but rarely used clinically for such disorders as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, periodic sensation of cold in the intestines.
